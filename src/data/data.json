        "paragraph": "Coinage is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Coinage is an open-source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Coinage features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, trade volume, and liquidity, Coinage is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.",

The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times, Halving, Mining reward, and a few other aspects.",
